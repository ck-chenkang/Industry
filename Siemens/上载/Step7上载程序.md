# Upload S7-300 Siemens Program using Ethernet cable
Dear PLC Technical members,

Welcome to our followers on the Blog PLC Technical, our topic today is very important this is what everyone's looking for it, this article show you step-by-step how to **upload Siemens S7-300** program over Ethernet câble.

## I. Upload S7-300 Siemens Program using Ethernet cable

As you saw in the title about how to **upload S7-300 Siemens** program over the Ethernet/IP cable for PLC Siemens to PC. Today we'll cover twelve points of interest and make sure you're going to get amazing results.

Before we begin, the **uploading S7-300 Siemens** Program with the Ethernet cable, let us take a look at CPU 317F-2PN/DP and The Difference between Ethernet and [Profibus DP](https://www.plctechnical.com/2020/03/upload-s7-300-siemens-program-using-Profibus-DP-cable.html)

### 1. Siemens S7-300 CPU317F-2 PN/DP

Siemens S7-300 CPU317F-2 PN/DP, One interface MPI/DP 12mbit/s, 2. interface Ethernet Profinet, with 2 port switch, With 1.5 Mbyte working memory, micro memory card necessary.

#### 1.1 Profibus DP 

A Profibus connection port it look just like a standard DB9 serial connector. Most Profibus cable,some Profibus-DP connectors have a go through the port on the rear of the connector with the goal that you would daisy be able to bind another gadget to the bus.


Note that the two sorts of connectors have a red switch on the back, this switch must be set the on position on the last gadget and off for each other gadget.

#### 1.2 Profinet PN

[Profinet ](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profinet)is a more current Ethernet-based Industrial correspondences convention the physical interface utilized for Profinet is a standard RJ45 Ethernet jack.

Profinet links are effectively conspicuous by their green shading while now and again a standard Ethernet link might be utilized to interface with Profinet gadgets official Profinet links ought to be utilized as they contain vigorous protecting enter intended to work well in unforgiving mechanical conditions.

Profinet works at 100 megabits for each second and links might be up to 100 meters long because of its fast activity and a reaction season of short of what one millisecond.

Profinet utilizes the indistinguishable physical association guidelines as Ethernet standard Ethernet switches can be used to broaden your framework.



Profinet devices have three different types of addresses an IP address a MAC address and a device name.

# upload S7-300 Siemens Program using Profibus DP cable

Dear PLC Technical members,

Welcome to our followers on the Blog PLC Technical, Today we will talk about a very important topic, this article will explain how to **upload S7-300 Siemens** Program using Profibus DP câble.

[![UPLOAD S7-300 SIEMENS PROGRAM USING PROFIBUS DP](E:\codes\Industry\Siemens\上载\Imag\UPLOAD-S7-300-SIEMENS-PROGRAM-USING-PROFIBUS-DP.webp)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DuGfzBwS5T8/XxSxWObgbfI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/zJKr22Wcd94OMwwSYtjIr5z_Am_PVb6kACNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/UPLOAD-S7-300-SIEMENS-PROGRAM-USING-PROFIBUS-DP.webp)

## I. upload S7-300 Siemens Program using Profibus DP cable 

We have to keep a look back at points, how to **upload S7-300 Siemens** PLC Program using Profibus DP. Before we look into the S7-300 Siemens Program Using Profibus DP câble, let us take a look at the S7-300 system.

**Please check this link:**

### 1. S7-300 System Hardware Structure

An S7-300 system consists of the following modules:

-  Power supply (PS)
- CPU 317-2DP: SIMATIC CPU 317-2 DP 1 x 12 Mbits RS-485 Interface PROFIBUS DP/MPI (Master/Slave), 512 KBytes Memory for User Program and Data, No Integrated Input/Output, Integrated 24V DC Power Supply, required Micro Memory Card.

-  Signal blocks (SM)
-  Function blocks (FM)
-  Communication processor (CP)

#### 1.1 Profibus DP Cable

The [PROFIBUS ](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profibus)bus cable enables communication between several S7-300 with each other or with Input /Output modules.
To program the S7-300, a PC / notebook (with the corresponding interface module) or a programming device (PG) loaded with the Step7 software is required. 
The PG is connected to the CPU 317-2DP with a special cable (Profibus cable) for **uploading S7-300 Siemens** Program.

## I. Upload S7-300 Siemens Program using MPI cable

In this article am going to talk about how to make a backup of your Program from the PLC to PC. So first of all to take **upload S7-300 Siemens** Program of the CPU318-2 we need an MPI Port well this particular article I'am using an [MPI cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Point_Interface) to connect may CPU318-2 with my laptop or a PC.

I need Programming cable which is a to USB cable you have to Download it drivers these are available on the Siemens website once you have downloaded the drivers you just have to install and it will work fine.



### 1. Fundamentals to upload S7-300 Siemens Program

Before we look into the **uploading of the S7-300 Siemens** Program, let us take a look at Siemens S7-300 PLC and MPI port of the CPU 318-2.

####  1.2 MPI 

The MPI port on the CPU module can be configured for either MPI network in this procedure will see how to access to a S7-300 Program Siemens PLC over MPI cable.



[![MPI cable](E:\codes\Industry\Siemens\上载\Imag\mpi+cable.webp)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VbkHkyj6wE4/Xm4jaRPcGCI/AAAAAAAAHbY/0Ga4IekUqm8Kdqke4skXc7mqRLJXlH8dgCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/mpi%2Bcable.webp)

So let's start to **upload S7-300 Siemens** Program via MPI cable, following is the steps you need:

1. Set PG/PC Interface
2. Choose the "PC Adapter Auto
3. STONLINE (STEP7) =>PC ADAPTER.MPI
4. Up Menu. Select File 
5. Create a project in a new path 
6. The Project Name is "MPICPU318" 
7. Upload to PLC-->PC 
8. Lets **upload S7-300 Siemens** Program from CPU318-2 to laptop
9. Take the source of SIEMENS PLC Program CPU318-2 
10. The hardware you can look at what is on the Rack

\1. First, we need to determine the interface PG/PC with SIMATIC, manager communicates with the Siemens PLC. From the SIMATIC manager menu. Select options->set PG/PC Interface to launch the unity for the setting the online interface for the PC



[![PGPC interface](E:\codes\Industry\Siemens\上载\Imag\PGPC+interface.webp)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-31JHzWl4KZs/Xm4s6-P6c5I/AAAAAAAAHbk/_mLFQHwR-ZMwU1Pyv-YJkZGdwHtqHMtMQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/PGPC%2Binterface.webp)

\2. Look for "PC Adapter MPI.1", if you are not sure whether the MPI/DP port on the CPU module is preconfigured for MPI, choose the "PC Adapter Auto". Press OK to save properties



[![Dialog for defining PGPC interface](E:\codes\Industry\Siemens\上载\Imag\Dialog+for+defining+PGPC+interface.webp)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rpD1K3g16Hw/Xm4tdTNFciI/AAAAAAAAHbs/59HkTqGQLD8MYX75P2vyJM8hqlrB5lF8wCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Dialog%2Bfor%2Bdefining%2BPGPC%2Binterface.webp)

\3. Once the selection is made the access of applications will reflect the newly selected interface. The setting should show STONLINE (STEP7) =>PC ADAPTER. MPI. Next OK and OK

\7. View (or afficher if french version) this is going to search for any MPI on the network. Here we have selected CPU318-2, to upload with Address MPI:2 ==>confirm with OK In the case below we are discussing to a Siemens PLC CPU318-2 over MPI with the address 2.

\8. Lets **upload S7-300 Siemens** Program from CPU318-2 to Computer (PC/PG). In the Figure program is being uploaded
